Company X Daily To Do Board
    Welcome, I hope you are having a wonderful day. 
    I would like to invite you to check out my progressive web app, made with React. 
    I modeled this app to reflect a daily work board at your company, and sharpen my React skills, while on my job search. 
    I used Googles Firebase Auth system to authenticate users, FireStore to manage the NoSQL Database, and deployed with Firebase, while Redux manages the store. 
    Any authenticated user can add goals, while self or other auth users can complete said goals. 
    Feel free to try it out on mobile as well, and leave comments. Thank You.
